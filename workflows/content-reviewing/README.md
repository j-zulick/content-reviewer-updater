# 📝 Content Reviewing Workflows

This directory contains two Dify workflows designed for content quality automation:

## 1. Content Reviewer
Analyzes an article and returns only the issues that need changes.

## 2. Content Reviewer & Updater
Reviews, fixes, and rewrites content automatically, returning the updated article.

Upload both YAML workflow files into this folder:

- `Content Reviewer.yml`
- `Content Reviewer & Updater.yml`
